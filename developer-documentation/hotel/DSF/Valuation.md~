Method Goals
============

This method aims to return the total price and cancel policies of the
selected *Option*. This *Option* **must** be selected in the previous
step (*Avail*).

|

Request Format
==============

The *Valuation* request is same that availabilityRQ and add rooms and
Mealplan code.

|

Response Format
===============

The returned XML contains the total price and list of cancel policies.
Sometimes this method will fail since the selected option at *Avail*
time will not be available in this stage. In this case the integration
returns one of our errors: code 301. For more information of our errors,
please consult the paragraph "Lists of Data"

|

Remarks
=======

The maximum time, that is permitted in our system, before the connection
is closed, is of **180000** milliseconds.

Detailed Description
====================

**Providers with allotment blockage**

There are some providers which, for their internal reasons, block the
allotments of the petitions. If this should be the case, the clients
have to relaunch automatically the valuation, provided that it has past
more than 30 minutes of the last valuation petition.

Given the case, that a provider has a specific transaction for blocking
allotments ( normally called pre-confirmation, quote, booking with a
parameter quote.. ), then there is two possible paths that you need to
follow:

-   If the provider assures a blockage equal or superior to 30 minutes
    then you will have to do the blockage of allotment petition.
-   If the provider doesn't assure a blockage superior of 30 minutes
    then the petition of blockage of allotment will have to be done in
    the booking petition.

|

**Status:**

The valuation response depends the parameter \<OnRequest\> set: In case
that the parameter \<OnRequest\> is set as false, the integration filter
this options if the supplier provide us the new status with value on
request in ValuationRS, then we return an error because the provider
change the status option. In case that the parameter \<OnRequest\> is
set as true, we don't filter the option.
