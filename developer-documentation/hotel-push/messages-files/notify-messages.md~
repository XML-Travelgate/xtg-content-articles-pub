**Important information:**

-   The prices under the standard occupancy are ALWAYS loaded with
    BaseByGuestAmts.
-   Children and babies are not allowed in BaseByGuestAmts. Children and
    babies must be always defined in AdditionalGuestAmounts.
-   The possible Type values in the AdditionalGuestAmount tag are
    Exclusive and not specified.

   > -   If there's no value specified then the price is a relative.
   >     And it's added to the price of the current pax.
   > -   If the value is "Exclusive" then the price is absolute. And
   >     it's the total price of the current pax.

-   If NumberOfGuests is not specified in tag BaseByGuestAmt then
    Type="25" (price per room) or Type="14" (price per occupancy) must
    be specified. If Type="25" only one tag BaseByGuestAmt is allowed.
-   If the price is per room then all AdditionalGuestAmount must be
    relative.

- If the price is per occupancy then Type should be 14 and Code should
be specified. 

The occupancy code is defined by
AdultNumber-ChildNumber-InfantNumber, for an occupancy of 2 adults, 1
child and 0 babies should be "2-1-0".

-   In samples room uses are specified using = AdultNumber -
    ChildNumber - InfantNumber.

**Notify amounts by Occupancy:**

Case 1:

Room uses = 1-0-0, 2-0-0, 3-0-0.

We only load price occupancy = 2 adults, 0 child and 0 baby.



    <BaseByGuestAmts>
        <BaseByGuestAmt Type = "14" AmountAfterTax="100.00" Code = "2-0-0"/>
    </BaseByGuestAmts>

    <BaseByGuestAmts>
        <BaseByGuestAmt Type = "14" AmountAfterTax="95.00" Code = "2-1-0"/>
        <BaseByGuestAmt Type = "14" AmountAfterTax="80.00" Code = "2-0-1"/>
