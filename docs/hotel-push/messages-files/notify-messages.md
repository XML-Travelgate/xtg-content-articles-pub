**Important information:**

-   The prices under the standard occupancy are ALWAYS loaded with
    BaseByGuestAmts.
-   Children and babies are not allowed in BaseByGuestAmts. Children and
    babies must be always defined in AdditionalGuestAmounts.
-   The possible Type values in the AdditionalGuestAmount tag are
    Exclusive and not specified.

   > -   If there's no value specified then the price is a relative.
   >     And it's added to the price of the current pax.
   > -   If the value is "Exclusive" then the price is absolute. And
   >     it's the total price of the current pax.

-   If NumberOfGuests is not specified in tag BaseByGuestAmt then
    Type="25" (price per room) or Type="14" (price per occupancy) must
    be specified. If Type="25" only one tag BaseByGuestAmt is allowed.
-   If the price is per room then all AdditionalGuestAmount must be
    relative.

- If the price is per occupancy then Type should be 14 and Code should
be specified. 

The occupancy code is defined by
AdultNumber-ChildNumber-InfantNumber, for an occupancy of 2 adults, 1
child and 0 babies should be "2-1-0".

-   In samples room uses are specified using = AdultNumber -
    ChildNumber - InfantNumber.



**Notify amounts by Guests:**

Case 1:

Standard occupancy = 2.

Room uses = 1-0-0, 2-0-0.

We only load the price for standard occupancy.


~~~xml
    <BaseByGuestAmts>
        <BaseByGuestAmt NumberOfGuests = "2" AmountAfterTax="100.00"/>
    </BaseByGuestAmts>  
~~~


There is no price for one adult, so it wont be available.

The price of two adults will be 100 = 2\*(100/2).



Case 2:

Standard occupancy = 2.

Room uses = 1-0-0, 2-0-0.

We load the price for standard occupancy and the price for 1 Adult.


~~~xml
    <BaseByGuestAmts>
        <BaseByGuestAmt NumberOfGuests = "1" AmountAfterTax="100.00"/>
        <BaseByGuestAmt NumberOfGuests = "2" AmountAfterTax="130.00"/>
    </BaseByGuestAmts>
~~~

The price of one Adult (Also known as Double Single Use) will be 100 =
100.

The price of two adults will be 130 = 2\*(130/2).



Case 3:

Standard occupancy = 2.

Room uses = 1-0-0, 2-0-0, 3-0-0.

We load the price for standard occupancy and the price for 1 additional
Adult Type default.


~~~xml

    </AdditionalGuestAmounts>
~~~


There is no price for one adult, so it wont be available.

The price of two Adult will be 100 = 2\*(100/2).

The price of three Adults will be 190 = (100/2) + (100/2) + ((100/2) +
(40).



Case 4:

Standard occupancy = 2

Room uses = 1-0-0, 2-0-0, 3-0-0

We load the price for standard occupancy and the price for 1 additional
Adult Type Exclusive.

### HotelResNotif

Only implements if the Channel manager allows reservation delivery. 

During the booking process, we will send a HotelResNotifRQ message to the Channel to inform about the reservations. 
The Channel will process the booking info and will inform us of the reservation status. TGX will process the response from the Channel's system and will proceed with the reservation process.

If the Channel has the booking locator of the reservation, they can send it in the HotelResNotifRS.

Note that if the reservation into the Channel system fails, it will be considered NOK and we will inform the OTA with an error.

### CancelNotif

Only implements if the Channel Manager allows cancellation delivery. 

During the cancellation process, we will send a CancelNotifRQ message to the Channel to inform of the cancellation. 
The Channel will process the cancellation info and will inform us of the reservation status. TGX will process the response from the Channel's system and will proceed with the cancellation process.

Note that if the cancellation into the Channel system fails, it will be considered NOK and we will inform the OTA with an error.
